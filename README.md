# CSE-170-project

This is the code for my final design project. I have implemented 2 screens - The homepage and the reserve equipment page

To view the web application download the files locally.

Place all 7 files in the same directory and run home.html on your browser.

The homepage has a carousel that users can use to learn about the latest news and offers!

You can navigate to the reserve equipment page using the navbar on the top and clicking "Manage Reservations"

In the reserve equipment page, there is a dropdown to select your desired equipment type, An input field where you choose the reservation date, two time input fields where you choose your start and end time, and finally a confirm button.
